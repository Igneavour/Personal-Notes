# Impact of data science in people's life

- Using technology leaves digital footprint.
- Computer systems in this age have the ability to store and process huge amount of data.
- Data includes those that we generate as a result of our activities and hence, it is possible to build systems which never forget.
- In most cases, such systems benefit the customers, since the data allows companies to improve their products and services.
- Other cases, data might affect people negatively such as eroding privacy and personal space.

# Data-driven technologies

- Internet-of-Things devices
- Wearable devices
- Online services (banking, shopping, services provided by local and national governments)
- Various surveillance technologies

# Data points

- A data point can be considered as a single unit of observation.
- The most immediate notion of a data point is a numerical value.
> can be integer, real or complex
- Or binary:
> 0/1 or True/False

# Dataset

- A dataset is a collection of data points.
- Usually 2D, with rows representing <b>entities</b> (items) and columns representing <b>attributes</b> (features).
- Entities, in most cases are a part of a collection, such as books in a library or items in a shop.
- Attributes, describe the entities and can be of different types.

# Issues with the dataset

- Real-world data is not always consistent.
- Missing attributes
- Attributes of incorrect type or with incorrect values.
- Requires pre-processing (cleaning)
