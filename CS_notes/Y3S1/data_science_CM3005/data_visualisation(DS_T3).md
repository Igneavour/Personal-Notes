# Data in context of data visualisation

- Quantitative 
	- Data that has been generated through measurements of quantity
- Qualitative
	- Concerned about the quality of things

# The DRIP syndrome

- Data Rich but Information Poor
- Data != Information
- Data in itself is not useful, to turn data into information, we can use data visualisation

# How do we make sense of data?

Visualisation
- using graphics to explore and understand data

Data Mining
- searching for patterns and trends

Machine Learning
- build models, test theories, predict the future

# Defining data visualisation

> Making visible the patterns and structures in data using graphs, tables, diagrams, maps etc

<p style="font-size:300%;"> Amplify cognition </p>

## Other definitions

> The representation and presentation of data that exploits our visual perception abilities in order to amplify cognition

## Information visualisation

> The use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition

# Information vs scientific visualisation

Information visualisation
- quantitative data representing abstract concepts, processes and behaviours
	- e.g share prices, child literacy, sales, happiness
- focus on understanding social, psychological, economic phenomena

Scientific visualisation
- quantitative data representing physical objects
	- e.g geographic data, human body, cell structure, gravity
- understanding the structure of the physical world

## Similarities

- use visual modality
- represent data in ways our brain can comprehend

## Shared objectives

- amplify cognition
- create and communicate knowledge
