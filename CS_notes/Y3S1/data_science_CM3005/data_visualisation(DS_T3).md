# Data in context of data visualisation

- Quantitative 
	- Data that has been generated through measurements of quantity
- Qualitative
	- Concerned about the quality of things

# The DRIP syndrome

- Data Rich but Information Poor
- Data != Information
- Data in itself is not useful, to turn data into information, we can use data visualisation

# How do we make sense of data?

Visualisation
- using graphics to explore and understand data

Data Mining
- searching for patterns and trends

Machine Learning
- build models, test theories, predict the future

# Defining data visualisation

> Making visible the patterns and structures in data using graphs, tables, diagrams, maps etc

<p style="font-size:300%;"> Amplify cognition </p>

## Other definitions

> The representation and presentation of data that exploits our visual perception abilities in order to amplify cognition

## Information visualisation

> The use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition

# Information vs scientific visualisation

Information visualisation
- quantitative data representing abstract concepts, processes and behaviours
	- e.g share prices, child literacy, sales, happiness
- focus on understanding social, psychological, economic phenomena

Scientific visualisation
- quantitative data representing physical objects
	- e.g geographic data, human body, cell structure, gravity
- understanding the structure of the physical world

## Similarities

- use visual modality
- represent data in ways our brain can comprehend

## Shared objectives

- amplify cognition
- create and communicate knowledge

# Semiotics of graphics

- study of visual symbols and how they convey meaning 
- classical views of Saussure
	- all symbols are arbitrary
	- must be learnt
	- no system of representation can be better than any other
- scientific view
- the visual system has particular properties (product of evolution)
- different forms of representation are more closely aligned with our perception mechanisms
- there is some grounds for determining better/worse forms of visual communication

## Sensory vs Arbitrary symbols

<b>sensory</b> "aspects of visualisations that derive their expressive power from their ability to use the perceptual processing power of the brain without learning"

<b>arbitrary</b> "aspects of representation that must be learned, because the representations have no perceptual basis"

# What can we do with visualisations?

'Data visualisation is an umbrella term to cover all types of visual representations that support the exploration, examination and communication of data'

## Uses for data visualisation

- analysis
- communication
- monitoring
- planning

# Data visualisation types

## Exploratory
- early stages of research
- interactive
- quick and dirty
- helps discover trends and patterns

## Explanatory
- later stages of research
- polished, publication/presentation ready
- conveys a clear message
- makes a point or answers question
