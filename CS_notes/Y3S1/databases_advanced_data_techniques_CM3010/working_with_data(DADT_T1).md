# Where does your data come from?
- New data
- Pre-existing
	- Internal 'Legacy' data
	- External data

## New data

- Could be added as you go
- Bulk data entry

## Pre-existing data

### Internal data

- May need:
	- Extraction
	- Conversion
	- Cleaning

### External sources

- No costs for data entry
- No costs for quality checks
- Delegated expertise

However, using external sources have the following risks:

- No control over data quality
- No control over data structure
- May be incomplete
- May be ambiguous
- Question of trustworthiness

# What does your data look like?

When trying to model real-life data and prepare to put in a database,
- What the use of the data is
- What sort of information you would be interested in

## Week 1.105 example

# Licenses, sharing and ethics

Decisions about whether your data will be proprietary or open are often taken at an institutional level. Research funding bodies, normally require your data to be open, and many governments and their agencies have similar restrictions. Whichever way these decisions go, the exact nature and terms of the license can have a significant impact on the legal re-use of your data.

- What we mean by my data, their data, your data.
- Who can we pass that data onto beyond ourselves, how widely can we distribute it, and under what terms.
- What we are allowed to do with that data.

## Why publish open data?

- Commercially, to drive sales
- Ethically, for the common good
- Contract requirements, particularly the case with governments and research organisations.
- Interoperability

## Why not publish open data?

- Restrictions on source data, contains intellectual property or personal information or commercially sensitive
- Control how data is used
- Data itself might be a product

# What shape is your data?

## Sorts of Structure

- Structures in programming environments: data types or data structures
- Structures in data models
- Structures in serializations: data formats
- Structures in exchange protocols
- Structures in user interfaces

## Shapes available

- Tables: General-purpose
- Trees: Heterogeneous and hierarchical, structured data
- Graphs: Heterogeneous, non-hierarchical, structured data
- Media (raw data): Searchable information derived from blobs
- Documents / objects: Rich but not interrelated data
